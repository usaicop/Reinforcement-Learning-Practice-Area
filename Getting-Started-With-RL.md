# USAICOP Reinforcement Learning Practice Area

Welcome to the USAICOP (US AI Community of Practice) Reinforcement Learning Practice Area! This repository is dedicated to sharing knowledge, resources, and discussions around the application of reinforcement learning (RL) within the federal government.
This is not intended to display official communications or policy, or an official information source on the federal government's use of reinforcement learning. This is intended to be a learning resource.

## Join the Discussion
Feel free to participate in our [Discussions](https://github.com/usaicop/Reinforcement-Learning-Practice-Area/discussions) to share your experiences, ask questions, and collaborate with other members of the USAICOP community.

## Contact
For any questions or suggestions, please contact us at [ai-cop-support-team@gsa.gov](mailto:ai-cop-support-team@gsa.gov).
## About This Repository

This repository serves as a hub for:

- **Discussions:** Engage with the community, ask questions, and share insights on reinforcement learning.
- **Resources:** Find links to general learning materials and resources about reinforcement learning.
- **Government Use Cases:** Learn how various federal agencies are implementing reinforcement learning in their operations.

## Federal Government Applications of Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning (RL) powers a lot of different systems from your vacuum robot to autonomous space flight systems. Here are a few examples:

1. **National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA):** Exploring improving [deep space communications](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20190026713/downloads/20190026713.pdf) and [deep space network scheduling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.05167) using RL.
